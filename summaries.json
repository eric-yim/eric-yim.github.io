Diverse educational backgrounds: Many of the interviewees did not have a degree specifically in data science, but came from backgrounds like business, psychology, or other fields. They often supplemented their education with bootcamps, online courses, or self-teaching.\n\n2. Competitive compensation: Salaries for data-related roles ranged from around $100,000 to over $300,000, with equity and bonuses contributing significantly to total compensation. However, some felt they were underpaid relative to the market.\n\n3. Importance of practical experience: Several interviewees emphasized the value of building a portfolio of personal projects and applying skills, rather than relying solely on certifications or degrees.\n\n4. Advice to network and advocate for yourself: Interviewees recommended networking, being proactive about asking for raises or negotiating compensation, and not being afraid to advocate for yourself in the job market."

Compensation and Feeling Undervalued: Many teachers express that they do not feel fairly compensated for the work they do, despite often having advanced degrees. There is a sentiment that teachers are systemically undervalued.\n\n2. Passion for the Job: Despite the compensation challenges, the teachers consistently express a deep passion for their work and a love for teaching and working with students. Many say they do it for the joy of the job, not the paycheck.\n\n3. Advice to Aspiring Teachers: The experienced teachers advise aspiring teachers to pursue the profession out of a genuine passion for it, rather than for the money. They emphasize the importance of perseverance and not giving up, as it may take time to find the right teaching position.\n\nIn summary, the teachers highlight the challenges of low compensation but also the immense fulfillment they find in their work, and they encourage others to enter the field out of a true calling rather than financial motivations."

Many of the interviewees, especially those in trade jobs like construction, welding, and iron working, emphasize the importance of hands-on skills and experience over formal education. They suggest that certifications and on-the-job training are often more valued than degrees in these fields.\n\n2. Several interviewees mention the potential safety risks and physical demands of their jobs, particularly in construction and manual labor roles. However, they also highlight the good pay and benefits, especially for unionized workers.\n\n3. The salary ranges reported vary widely, from around $15 per hour for retail and service jobs to over $100,000 per year for skilled trades, technical roles, and some entrepreneurial ventures. This underscores the diversity of earning potential within the job group."

High earning potential: Many of the nurses and healthcare professionals interviewed reported annual incomes ranging from $80,000 to over $200,000, with some nurse anesthetists and nurse practitioners earning over $280,000. This suggests the job group has significant earning potential, especially with specialization and experience.\n\n2. Importance of work-life balance: Several interviewees highlighted the benefits of flexible schedules, ability to work from home, and control over their hours as positives of their roles. This suggests work-life balance is an important factor for this job group.\n\n3. Desire for better compensation: While many felt well compensated, some nurses expressed a desire for higher pay, especially those in certain geographic areas or settings like bedside nursing. This indicates compensation is an ongoing concern and area for improvement.\n\nOverall, the interviews suggest the nursing and healthcare roles in this group offer attractive salaries, flexibility, and career growth opportunities, though there is still room for improvement in compensation and work conditions in some cases."
